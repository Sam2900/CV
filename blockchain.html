    <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">My take on blockchain.</h3>
<h4 style="font-weight: normal ;">Blockchain is one of the most advanced part of modern technology to be explored, and in my opinion, 
    we haven't scratcheds the surface yet.</h4>
<p><h4 style="font-weight: 100;" >There are many applications to blockchain, and it goes beyound digital currencies, blockchain can also be applied to various real time aspects like:
    <em><ul>
        <li>real-estate</li>
        <li>The argricultural sector</li>
        <li>politics</li>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Banking and Finance, and any other sector you could think of. </li>
    </ul></em>
<h4 style="font-weight: 300;">Blockchain is based on a node type technology, where input data are subjected to honest nodes,
    and embedding in them solution to a puzzle like script,
    and this honest nodes resolve this puzzle and subjects it to a unique reciever, in digital currency terms,
    it is called a recievers public address.
